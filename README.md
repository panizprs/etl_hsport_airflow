In this repository, I implemented a simple ETL via Python and SQL. I got inspired by the LinkedIn Learning Course ["ETL in Python and SQL"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/etl-in-python-and-sql?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A65b2a77734502009ca4015bc). I followed these steps:
1) Load data from Excel and transform it into Pandas DataFrame.
2) Load Pandas DataFrame into SQL DB.
3) Automate it via Airflow.
